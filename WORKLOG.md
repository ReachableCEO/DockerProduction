# KNEL Cloudron Packaging Work Log

## 📅 2025-01-04 - Foundation & Documentation Day

### 🏗️ Repository Setup and Organization
**Time Investment**: ~4 hours

#### Achievements
- ✅ **Repository Structure Analysis**: Analyzed existing structure, confirmed workspace approach is optimal
- ✅ **Enhanced .gitignore**: Added patterns for temporary packaging directories and OS files
- ✅ **Container Environment**: Established persistent `tsys-cloudron-packaging` container for all development
- ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation**: Created complete project documentation suite

#### Files Created/Updated
- 📝 **README.md**: Comprehensive repository documentation with quick start guide
- 📋 **PLAN.md**: Strategic roadmap for packaging 56 applications across 2025
- 📊 **TASKS.md**: Detailed task list with 56 applications categorized by priority
- 📖 **WORKLOG.md**: This progress tracking document
- 🔧 **.gitignore**: Enhanced with packaging workflow patterns

#### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Git Workflow**: Implemented feature branch strategy (`feature/package-[appname]` → `integration` → `master`)
2. **Development Environment**: All packaging work containerized for consistency
3. **Application Prioritization**: 4-tier priority system based on business criticality
4. **Documentation Standards**: Comprehensive build notes required for each package

#### Progress on Applications
- 🚧 **InvenTree**: Package structure created in container (70% complete)
  - CloudronManifest.json ✅
  - Dockerfile ✅ 
  - start.sh ✅
  - Configuration files ✅
  - **Next**: Testing and finalization
  
- 🚧 **APISIX**: Package development started (20% complete)
  - Research completed ✅
  - CloudronManifest.json ✅
  - **Next**: Dockerfile and configuration

### 🔍 Insights & Lessons Learned
1. **Container Approach**: Working in containerized environment eliminates host differences
2. **Workspace Pattern**: Gitignored upstream sources keep repository clean while preserving access
3. **Documentation First**: Establishing clear documentation before scaling prevents confusion
4. **Priority Categorization**: Business-critical applications should be packaged first

### 🎯 Next Session Goals
1. Complete InvenTree package and test deployment
2. Finish APISIX packaging
3. Start Jenkins package (Tier 1 priority)
4. Set up integration branch workflow
