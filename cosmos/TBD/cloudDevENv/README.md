# Cloud dev at tsys 

## Desired architecute

(essentially the lap.dev architecure)

- control plane running as a web app on cosmos 
- agent that spins up ephermeral containers on runner hosts


## Contenders 

- strong.network
- lap.dev (dont like that it only supports github/gitlab oautg) (also that it doesnt appear to be dockerized)

## Links 

- https://github.com/strong-network/images
